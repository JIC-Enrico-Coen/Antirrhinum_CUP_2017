This is a set of computational models associated with the paper "Formation and Shaping of the Antirrhinum Flower through Modulation of the CUP Boundary Gene", by Rebocho et al. Current Biology 27, 2610â€“2622
2017. [10.1016/j.cub.2017.07.064](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2017.07.064)

The model is in the folder:

GPT\_revisedCUP\_20170503

It can be run using the Matlab package GFtbox, which is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/JIC-Enrico-Coen/GrowthToolbox). GFtbox requires an installation of Matlab, which is commercial software available from [Mathworks](https://Mathworks.com).
